# Slope / Derivative Graphing Calculator for Polynomials
<br/>
A tool to graphicalize polynomials with thier 1st and 2nd derivatives, made with basic java without needing any special libraries to run.<br/>

<br/> There is also
<a href="https://larryzpl123.github.io/Prime-Graphing-Calculator-for-Polynomials/">a html simplified website version</a>
translated from the java file.<br/>
<br/>
input format is y = n , or y=nx^3 +/- nx^2 +/- nx +/- n, or input without y. <br/>
examples will be y = 2/3x + 1, y = -x, x = 0.6, y=0.6, y = 7.0x^10 -12.0x19 +4.0x^8 -15.0Ñ…^7 +9.0x^6 -3.0x^5 +11.0x^4 -8.0x^3 +6.0x^2 -5.0x +2.0 (and its 1st/slope and 2nd/acceleration derivative).
